This is the mach_support branch. It adds support for a subset of the mach
API as a precursor to supporting launchd.

Rudimentary Mach IPC is supported through libmach provided one's kernel
is compiled with COMPAT_MACH. The mach interface generator should be able
to work with modern .defs files.

Currently known to be missing are:
 - AF_SYSTEM domain sockets and the event protocols
 - The audit session system calls: audit_session_self and audit_session_join
 - XPC
   - The XPC_JETSAM_BANDs are unsupported

- MACH_SEND_NOTIFY

kevent flags:
- EVFILT_MACHPORT
- EVFILT_VM
	- NOTE_VM_PRESSURE
	- NOTE_VM_ERROR

#define	NOTE_EXITSTATUS		0x04000000	/* exit status to be returned, valid for child process only */
#define	NOTE_EXIT_DETAIL	0x02000000	/* provide details on reasons for exit */
/*
 * If NOTE_EXIT_DETAIL is present, these bits indicate specific reasons for exiting.
 */
#define NOTE_EXIT_DETAIL_MASK		0x00070000
#define	NOTE_EXIT_DECRYPTFAIL		0x00010000 
#define	NOTE_EXIT_MEMORY		0x00020000
#define NOTE_EXIT_CSERROR		0x00040000


libproc functions:
proc_get_dirty
proc_listallpids
proc_listchildpids
proc_listpgrppids
proc_pidinfo
proc_set_dirty
proc_setpcontrol
proc_terminate
proc_track_dirty

extended posix_spawnattr calls in support/posix_spawn.c are not expected
to actually work yet, among others

int
posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr, size_t count, cpu_type_t *pref,
         size_t *restrict ocount);

int
posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr, size_t count, cpu_type_t *pref,
							  size_t * restrict ocount);


I/O priority setting functionality - system call:
__iopolicysys


This is the top level of the FreeBSD source directory.  This file
was last revised on:
$FreeBSD$

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some
sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree, the most
commonly used one being ``world'', which rebuilds and installs
everything in the FreeBSD system from the source tree except the
kernel, the kernel-modules and the contents of /etc.  The ``world''
target should only be used in cases where the source tree has not
changed from the currently running version.  See:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
for more information, including setting make(1) variables.

The ``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat more involved process, documentation
for which can be found at:
   http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html
And in the config(8) man page.
Note: If you want to build and install the kernel with the
``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets, you might need to build
world before.  More information is available in the handbook.

The sample kernel configuration files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf
sub-directory (assuming that you've installed the kernel sources), the
file named GENERIC being the one used to build your initial installation
kernel.  The file NOTES contains entries and documentation for all possible
devices, not just those commonly used.  It is the successor of the ancient
LINT file, but in contrast to LINT, it is not buildable as a kernel but a
pure reference and documentation file.
